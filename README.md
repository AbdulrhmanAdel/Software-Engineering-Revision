# Software Engineering Revision
This repository contains my personal revision notes and implementations for software engineering topics. It is not a first-time study, but a focused review and practice to reinforce and deepen my understanding of these subjects.

## Structure
- `algorithm` — Sorting algorithms
- `data-structures` — Common data structure
- `design-patterns` — Common design patterns and their implementations

## Purpose
- To revisit and strengthen my grasp of software engineering principles, algorithms, and design patterns.
- To document concise, clear, and well-named code for future reference.

## Note
This is a revision project. Code and notes may reflect advanced understanding, optimizations, and personal preferences developed from prior study and experience.
